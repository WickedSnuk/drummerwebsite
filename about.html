                        Practice Drum is a focused, distraction-free practice space designed specifically for drummers.
                        Whether you're working on rudiments, technique, timing, endurance, or full practice routines, 
                        Practice Drum brings everything you need into one clean and organized place.
                    </p>

                        Most drummers get their exercises through scattered YouTube links, notes, and screenshots. 
                        Practice Drum turns that chaos into structure. Here, you can watch your lesson videos, follow your 
                        exercises, organize your routines, and track your progress — all from one central hub.
                    </p>

                        Practice Drum isn't a social platform. It's a practice tool.<br>
                        The goal is simple: help drummers practice smarter, stay consistent, and grow faster.

                    <h3 class="subsection-title animate-fade-in animate-delay-4">Why Practice Drum Exists</h3>
                    <p class="body-text animate-fade-in animate-delay-2">
                        As drummers, we collect practice material from many places — lesson videos, 
                        online exercises, rudiments, groove ideas, warmups, PDFs, and random inspiration clips. 
                        Over time, everything ends up spread across different apps, files, and links.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-text emphasis animate-fade-in animate-delay-3">
                        Practice Drum brings all of that into one clean, organized practice space. <br>
                        So instead of searching for what to work on, you can stay focused and keep growing.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title animate-fade-in animate-delay-4">The Vision</h3>
                    <p class="body-text animate-fade-in animate-delay-2">
                        To create the simplest, cleanest, and most effective practice environment for drummers of all levels. 
                        Rookies, intermediates, advanced players — everyone needs structure. 
                        Practice Drum gives you that structure without being overwhelming.
